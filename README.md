# NeuralNetwork
Building a neural network on numpy only. 
You can see in my results in the NeuralNetwork.ipnb where i documented every step. If you want to run my network in python you can use the main file 
which is a pyhton script. 
You can find the dataset here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/histopathologic-cancer-detection/data
